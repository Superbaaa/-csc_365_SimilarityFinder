CSC365 Assignment 1

Requirements:

This assignment asks you to create a similarity-based website recommendation system based on Wikipedia pages.
The program reads 10 (or more) Wikipedia pages. The URLs for these web pages can be maintained in a control file that is read when the program starts. Use a framework such as JSoup to extract text bodies etc from html.
Establish a similarity metric, that must include information based on custom frequency tables (as will be discussed in class), possibly weighted by or in conjunction with other attributes.
Create a user interface that allows a user to indicate one topic or site, and displays two similar ones. The presentation details are up to you. It may be a web/browser-based (for example Spring) or GUI base (Swing, JavaFX, or Android) for the GUI. For Swing, read through the relevant parts of the Swing tutorial first.
Use appropriate existing libraries for every component other than the custom similarity tracking.
